## Overall Architecture
- Google Cloud Functions that interact with a Google PostgreSQL instance
- React front end with yarn

The whole project is also live at [https://url.varunjindal.com](https://url.varunjindal.com)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- everything is functional on localhost (including the CORS requests to the Cloud function endpoints)

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

- All tests will run with this command (front-end and back-end)

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `yarn eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
